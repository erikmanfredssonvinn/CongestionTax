# Congestion Tax Calculator (API)

## Description
This is a simple API that calculates the congestion tax for vehicles in Gothenburg (and other cities!). The API is built using C# programming language and ASP.Net Core framework.

## Requirements
This project requires .NET 6.0 to run

## How to use
Either open the project in your favourite IDE that can run .NET projects (Rider, Visual Studio)
Then click run and the application will start

Or run trough the terminal by changing directory to path/to/CongestionTax/CongestionTaxApi and run
````dotnet run````

The application will run on your localhost on port 7125 by default, but you can change this in the launchSettings.json file.
At ```https://localhost:7125/swagger/index.html``` you can find the swagger documentation and test the APIs.

You can also test the APIs using Postman or any other API testing tool as well as your terminal.
