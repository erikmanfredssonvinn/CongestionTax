Most of the questions I have about the application and the task are "blocked" by the following questions:
Who will use the API and how is it intended to be used? In what context is the application intended to be used and exist in?

This is important, partly to create a good API design, but also to understand the requirements placed on the application.

What are the domains of the application, and is it really important to have an implementation for each type of vehicle?[worknotes.md](worknotes.md)
